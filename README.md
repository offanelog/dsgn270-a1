# Website review- Jerusalem Shawarma 
<h2> By Offanel Genelien </h2>
<em>In todays food industry a website is a crucial part in finding where to eat, what to eat, what they are about and who they are.
<h3><strong>Visual Hierachy</h3></strong>
<ol><p>
<li><strong>First impression</strong>
<p>My first impression of Jerusalem Shawarma, are those vibrant colors that pop out at you when you enter the website to support the picture and brightness. The layouts seem organized and scannable for all viewers. The colors work with each other and don’t dominate the page. It looks like a modern website. On the page though sometime the contrast makes it unreadable for some people.</p>
<li><strong>Goal of site</strong>
<p>The goal of the website is to attract customers looking for healthy, traditional but delicious mediterrnian food but to also provide the idea of home away from home food. 
Example: When you first enter the website you are greeted with beautiful food looking juicy, satisfying and healthy then, you scroll down and see an address/phone number then them supporting their photos by saying “Tasty mediterrianian menu”, “delicious and tasty middle east food” and “Fresh and healthy Shawarma wraps” 
Example for home away from 
home: The abouts us section.</p>
<li><strong>The use of Visual Hierachy</strong>
<p>The use of Visual Hierarchy throughout the website has been used very effectively, they use color, size of text and space. They also use a reading pattern that looks like a Z Pattern. When looking at the links at the top for menu or home or catering you see spacing throughout each. Corresponding colors also the size of text varies such as the logo its big but the links beside are small and scrolling down “ordering online” is big like it's screaming at you to order.</p></ol>
<br>Example of Visual Hierarchy: Dark colored and bigger header/title when introducing new topics especially Jerusalem catering.</br></li>
<br></br>
<h3><strong>Mental models and usability</h3></strong>
<ol><p>
<li><strong>Violations of Conventions</strong>
<p>On this website I don’t encounter any violations of conventions, everything is in place with perfect functionality.</p>
<li><strong>Scannable content or not</strong>
<p>The content is very scannable with preferable equalized spacing so the words are clear and easy to navigate the contents have good placing making it better for viewers to pay attention and to not be lost.</p>
<li><strong>Body text readable?</li></strong>

<p>The body text is equally divided in parts and readable. The site does need more contrast in other parts of the page for important parts other then contacting info and location.</p></ol>
<br></br>
<h3><strong>Mobile responsiveness</strong>
<ol><p>
<li>
<p>On mobile there is a scroll track.</p>
<li>Yes the business has a menu with prices but its not responsive but they have online ordering which is confusing to not have ordering and menu on same page which would be easier for everyone so they don’t have to go from menu to ordering. The site doesn't provide a QR code which is inconvenient for many users. </p></ol>
<br></br>
<h3><strong>Improvments</h3></strong>
<ul>
<li> More contrast
<li>Less repitvness when looking for things (example about us on home page then tab to other about us or menu being no responsive and then having to order at another tab)
</ul>
<br></br>
<p>
To conclude the overall site is amazing with a few minor problems.

But Overall amazing and good example of a site that makes use of the visual hiearchy.
